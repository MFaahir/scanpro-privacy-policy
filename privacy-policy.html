        collect, store, or share any of your personal data.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

      <h3>2.1 Information You Provide Directly</h3>

        <li>
          <strong>Usage analytics:</strong> We may collect anonymous usage statistics to understand
          how users interact with the App and to improve its features. This information is collected

          elsewhere.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Security measures:</strong> We implement appropriate security measures to protect
